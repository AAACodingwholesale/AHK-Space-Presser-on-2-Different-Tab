This is a script for Auto Hot Key V2, it should also work on V1, but I never put that in test.
A Windows Auto Hotkey V2 script that can press space on 2 different tabs. For example, you in a band that need to see how both bass line and guitar line on a same screen, but songsterr don't have this botton for it, this is the script you need then.
Also works for youtube and such needs for space on 2 different tabs.
If you need it not play at the exact same time, change the delay at the top, and adjust how you like.

HOW TO USE!!!
Set left window = Ctrl+Alt+1, right window = Ctrl+Alt+2, then press Ctrl+Alt+S to send Space to left then right as fast as Windows allows. (Ctrl+Alt+B sends Backspace to both.)
